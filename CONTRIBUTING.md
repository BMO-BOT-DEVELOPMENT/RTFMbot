# Contributing

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute ! It's appreciated.

These contributing guidelines are also subject to a code of conduct you should respect.

## Issues

Always verify that a similar issue doesn't exist before submitting yours.

If suitable, you should specify between square brackets wether your issue is a `BUG REPORT` or a `FEATURE REQUEST`.

### Bug report

Provide a complete explanation of the bug you intend to solve, including but not limited to:

- Expected / actual behaviour
- Steps to reproduce

### Feature request

Provide a complete explanation of the feature request. Try to include why and how it would be useful.

## Pull Request process

Always verify that your changes haven't been suggested or implemented before submitting your pull request.

You should perform proper tests before submitting your pull request.

### New features

Whenever possible, try to stick into only one file. Most features should be possible in a single command or group commands.
If you want to actually add a new cog, first discuss this option with issues and why this is necessary.

When adding new features, update the README.md accordingly:

- Do not modify the "helpful tools" section, as it is just an overview of the key features.
  You should add a concise description of the feature in the "Current features" section.

- When adding a documentation or a reference, you should follow the existing structure,
  which notably includes a link to the resource used to provide the service.

- When adding features in the Tools module, you should describe it in the "Small tools" section

You should include proper explanation of the feature you added and, if relevant,
how it can be useful.

### Bugfixing

If it already exists, add a link to an issue filing the bug. Else provide a complete explanation
of the bug you intend to solve, including but not limited to:

- Expected / actual behaviour
- Steps to reproduce

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
